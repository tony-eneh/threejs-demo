        <h1>Art Deco</h1>
        <p>
          Art Deco architecture flourished in New York City during the 1920s and
          1930s. The style broke with many traditional architectural conventions
          and was characterized by verticality, ornamentation, and building
          materials such as plastics, metals, and terra cotta. Art Deco is found
          in government edifices, commercial projects, and residential buildings
          in all five boroughs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The architecture of the period was influenced by worldwide decorative
          arts trends, the rise of mechanization, and New York City's 1916
          Zoning Resolution, which favored the setback feature in many
          buildings. The exuberant economy of the Roaring Twenties and
          commercial speculation spurred a citywide building boom. The size and
          sophistication of Art Deco ranged from towering skyscrapers to the
          modest middle-class housing and municipal buildings. Colorful,
          lavishly-decorated skyscrapers came to dominate the skyline of
          Manhattan before the Great Depression ended their construction.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Depression and changing tastes pushed the style to more subdued
          applications as it spread in the 1930s, becoming a style of choice for
          infrastructure projects and modern middle-class apartments in the
          outer boroughs. A lull in construction during World War II and the
          rise of the International Style led to the end of new Art Deco in the
          city.
        </p>
        <p>
          After falling out of favor and suffering from neglect during the
          city's downturn in the latter half of the 20th century, the city's Art
          Deco has been reappraised. Among New York's most treasured and
          recognizable skyscrapers are the Art Deco Empire State and Chrysler
          buildings. Art Deco skyscrapers formed the core of the city's skyline
          for decades and influence modern construction. Many of these buildings
          are protected by historic preservation laws, while others have been
          lost to new development or neglect.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          American Art Deco has its origins in European arts, especially the
          style moderne popularized at the 1925 International Exhibition of
          Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts in Paris, from which Art Deco
          draws its name (Exposition internationale des arts décoratifs et
          industriels modernes).
        </p>
        <p>
          While the United States did not officially participate,
          Americans—including New York City architect Irwin
          Chanin[1]: 55 —visited the exposition,[2]: 47  and the US government
          also sent a delegation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their resulting reports helped spread the style to America.[3]: 6 
          Other influences included German expressionism, the Austrian
          Secession, Art Nouveau, cubism, and the ornament of African, Central
          American, and South American cultures.[1]: 8–9 [4]: 4  American Art
          Deco architecture would assume different forms across the country,
          influenced by local culture, laws, and tastes.[2]: 42 
        </p>
        <p>
          Art Deco came into style just as New York City was being rapidly
          transformed. An exploding population, flush economic times, cheap
          credit, and lax zoning combined to encourage a building boom. The real
          estate market was so frenetic that buildings that had stood for just a
          few years were regularly torn down for newer construction.[5]: 42 
          New, larger buildings replaced multiple smaller structures on old
          lots.
        </p>
        <p>
          The amount of office space in New York City increased by 92% in the
          late 1920s.[5]: 49–50  Zoning regulations had major impacts on the
          design of buildings. The proliferation of ever-larger skyscrapers like
          the 40-story Equitable Building spurred New York City's passage of the
          US's first citywide zoning code, the 1916 Zoning Resolution.[6] The
          regulations, intended to prevent tall buildings from cutting off light
          and air at street level, required buildings to "set back" from street
          level depending on the width of the street and the zoned area.[7]
          After a building rose up and set back to cover 25 percent of the lot,
          the total height was unrestricted.[5]: 48  The impact of the new
          regulations did not materialize until later in the decade, as American
          entry into World War I slowed construction.[7] A monochromatic sketch
          in charcoal of a larged massed building. It has no windows or
          ornamentation, but climbs dramatically with piers that set back as the
          building rises. Hugh Ferriss' illustration, demonstrating an approach
          to New York City's setbacks requirements that would come to define the
          city's Art Deco buildings. Early buildings built to conform to the new
          codes did so unimaginatively—the Heckscher Building in Midtown
          (completed 1921) set back evenly like a stack of boxes as it rose—but
          more inspired interpretations of the law followed.[7] A major
          influence on the resulting skyscrapers was Eliel Saarinen's
          second-place design entry for Chicago's Tribune Tower, considered a
          new style distinct from earlier Gothic or Classical
          architecture.[2]: 7–8   
        </p>
        <p>
          Also influential were architect and illustrator Hugh Ferriss' series
          of speculative architectural illustrations exploring how to make
          buildings that met the zoning requirements.[4]: 4 [7][8] Ferriss'
          illustrations envisioned buildings as sculptural forms rather than
          simple boxes. Architect Talbot Hamlin described Ferriss' work as "a
          magic wand to set the American city architecture free from its
          nightmare [...] No longer was the high building apparently built by
          the mile and cut off to order, but it was composed break upon break,
          buttress on buttress. The possibilities of poetry entered
          in."[5]: 48–49  Precursors to the Art Deco skyscrapers that soon went
          up across the city were buildings such as Raymond Hood's American
          Radiator Building (1924), which was neo-Gothic in general style but
          featured abstract ornament that would characterize Art Deco.[9]
          Another early transitional building was the Madison Belmont Building
          at 181 Madison Avenue (1924–1925), which featured traditional
          ornamentation and organization on upper floors, combined with Art Deco
          motifs on the lower floors. The Art Deco ironwork was provided by
          Edgar Brandt, who contributed the entrance gates to the 1925 Paris
          Exhibition.[3]: 1, 5–6  One of the first Art Deco skyscrapers was the
          New York Telephone Company Building, built between 1923–1927 and
          designed by Ralph Thomas Walker. Its muted color and ornament did not
          fully demonstrate the style that soon flourished across the city, but
          its massing and verticality were thoroughly modern and broke with
          established architectural styles.[10][11][4]: 34–5
